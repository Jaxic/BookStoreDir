          <p class="text-text mb-4">
            Born Again Books began with a simple idea: to make it easier for readers to find and support independent bookstores in their communities. We believe that used bookstores are more than just places to buy booksâ€”they are cultural hubs, gathering spaces, and guardians of literary heritage.
          </p>
          <p class="text-text mb-4">
            Our directory brings together hundreds of bookstores from every province and territory, providing detailed information, search and filter tools, and a platform for discovery. Whether you're searching for a rare edition, a cozy reading nook, or a new favorite shop, Born Again Books is here to help you on your literary journey.
