They have 3 levels of books and a garage full of books.

Enjoy!",sweet alski,5,1732912024,"Juniper's Books is one of my favourite bookstores of all time. The store is literally an entire house (garage, attic, and basement included) filled with books from top to bottom! Each room is dedicated to a specific theme (spooky/horror is up in the attic, cuisine and cook books are in the kitchen, etc.) so finding what you are looking for is simple and quick if you need it to be.

Personally, however, my favourite way to spend time at Juniper's after being welcomed by friendly staff (including cat!), is by wandering aimlessly through the aisles of treasures. You can easily and gladly lose track of time at Juniper's Books and our city is blessed to have them!",megan thompson,5,1737500673,This bookstore is worth going out of your way to visit!

The store is a bit chaotic and it’s hard to find things but, once you get the hang of it, the hunt to find a book is a lot of fun.

Three staff we encountered were very helpful, kind, and passionate about books. One staff member audibly sighed when I asked for help reaching a novel, and seemed frustrated later when I was standing in an aisle he wanted to walk through — it is a tightly packed space!

Overall, we enjoyed our experience (and our full bag of books!), we will be back next summer ☀️"

She not only provided prompt and professional service but was also willing to engage with customers, answer questions, and offer recommendations.

The bookstore boasts a wide variety of books covering diverse topics and genres, from fiction to non-fiction, from history to science, catering to all interests.

Moreover, they have a treasure trove of rare and out-of-print books, making it a haven for collectors or those in search of unique finds.

In terms of pricing, I found the books offered to be very reasonable, sometimes even more so than other second-hand bookstores.

Additionally, the quality of the second-hand books is commendable; the book I recently purchased looked almost brand new.

Most importantly, despite not being an avid reader before, my pleasant experience at this bookstore has sparked a greater interest in reading for me.

Therefore, I highly recommend the Book Lover second-hand bookstore in North Vancouver to anyone, whether you're a book enthusiast or someone looking to cultivate a love for reading.

Huge collection of books from all genres and most of them are second hand and in very good condition. You can browse around or ask for assistance from staff.
All of them are friendly and well versed so they can be helpful resource if you are looking for a particular book or record. Yes! Not to miss , they have a separate music section and another section for kids

Even though I didn’t take any food picture while i was there but let me tell you very honestly that they have so so so much of bakery goods that you will have hard time deciding on what you want to eat.
Everything is freshly baked in brick oven so imagine the freshness and taste. For sure its not regular grocery store so prices are little on higher end. Not too too expensive though.
I tried pumpkin spice latte which is very creamy and flavourful , a person next to my table was raving all about the yellow spice turmeric latte. Apple strudel i had just melted in my mouth and i am guessing that their all time famous is onion,rosemary,walnut bun as not only me but almost every other person bought it.
They also have customized chocolates with engraving of thank you and happy birthday.

The owner is very knowledgeable about the books he has (and doesn’t have) in inventory.

We browsed for a while and selected a couple of books for purchase.

Things to note. Since there are a lot of books and Lego, there isn’t a lot of room to maneuver.

Additionally, the terminal doesn’t like tap for debit, apparently. You can tap with Visa and Mastercard or you can insert your debit card in the machine. This happened quite a bit while we were browsing and the owner needed to explain. Basically, no debit if it’s in your mobile wallet only.

Overall, it’s a quaint little place. We may need to stop by on occasion to see if there are any “new” books available.",Aleksandra Posmetnaya,5,1714521591,"Stepping into this bookstore is like entering a literary wonderland, where each corner and shelf seems to whisper tales from different eras. The atmosphere is incredibly cozy and welcoming, making it easy to lose yourself for hours among the well-curated selection of books that span centuries of storytelling. It's a place that not only caters to the bibliophile but also to those seeking a quiet, friendly nook to unwind and explore.What sets this bookstore apart is the delightful surprise of a Lego section. This creative corner is stocked with an impressive array of Lego sets, appealing to both young builders and adult collectors. It’s not just a side attraction but a fully integrated experience that bridges the gap between playful creativity and the intellectual stimulation of reading.The combination of books and Legos creates a uniquely inspirational space, fostering imagination across mediums. It provides a safe and inviting environment where passions for constructing worlds, whether through building blocks or within the pages of a book, are celebrated and nurtured.This bookstore is truly a magical destination. It is a sanctuary for those who love to read, build, and dream, making it a perfect spot for anyone looking to be inspired or to find solace in both new stories and timeless classics. Whether you're a seasoned reader or a Lego enthusiast, this charming spot offers a delightful blend of both worlds.",Romy,5,1739053648,"One of my favourite book shops in Toronto, I can easily spend an hour in here just looking through their massive selection.

Found this little gem in the heart of the Annex the other day, and I am very happy that I did.

I've been strolling through the city and visiting a lot of second-hand bookstores, and I must say I feel at one with Doug Miller's Books!

What I really love about the charm of the store is the easy layout and being able to access books based on what reading mood I happen to be in at that moment.

I also really like the fact that there's an emphasis on the classics and their front and center. Easy to locate and easy to find.

Much of the inventory is from the 2000s and alot of the paperbacks are from the '70s to the '90s. They do stock more current books as well, including some YA genre fiction.

this store is full of beautiful classics in editions i doubt you could find elsewhere, and even then, definitely not for as low a price. i love the feeling of finding little pieces of newspaper clippings and notes written by the last owner. they make every visit of mine a wonderful and exciting experience.

during my last visit, i spoke with Adam Alfsen and learned that his parents had originally owned the bookstore and were both incredibly talented artists like himself. the family's artworks are displayed throughout the interior. it gives me such a newfound appreciation for the already warm atmosphere.

i was gifted a book written by Alfsen himself, titled Lost Prophets of the Agora (on Plato & Scripture), and although it's not my usual reading, it was undoubtedly a very thorough and thought-provoking one.

i have found some books from here that i will treasure forever. i truly find it to be such a privilege to have such a bookstore so accessible to me. thank you, adam !"

1. Sadly, pet allergies are becoming a serious issue. We carry an epi-pen thankfully wherever we go. Unfortunately we did not ever consider a public store would have a cat wondering about considering the severity of some people's allergies. To my surprise... there was one in the store wondering about.

When it comes to allergies, cleanliness, etc... for most people this makes the space warm and inviting, for others, it can mean an unexpected trip to the ER.

I feel in this case a noticeable warning sign on the door could prevent this in the future.

2. The pricing for used books was just a bit too high. For those who buy new, definitely this is cheaper. For those who get their books from places like Value Village, this is more more expensive overall.

3. The navigation of the store is quite difficult. So if there are specific books you are looking for, they are quite hard to find.

Overall, if the navigation would have been easier, prices about 25% less or better and no kitty, I would have likely spent around $200 in books in my shop in this store as I'm presenting building quite a library. It was just too many things working against me during my shop.

After digging around in this store for literally hours -- which was fun, there are tens of thousands of books here -- I brought a stack of books I'd found around the store to the checkout, only for the owner (I assume) to re-evaluate and re-price the books by searching online listings while I was standing there.

This is a pretty lazy and greedy business practice. First off, he referred to listings on Abebooks that were still for sale, meaning these weren't prices that the book had SOLD for -- they were prices that sellers were listing them at, and these prices are often very inflated. These are prices that people AREN'T paying (considering they are all still for sale).

Also, he made no effort to offer me a fair price. I would think that considering the fact that I was there, in the store, ready to make a purchase, the least he could do is offer me a realistic price, especially considering he didn't even know these books were down there and they probably would have collected dust for another couple years. I am not an online customer somewhere across the world. I dug through the store and found the books, only to be told ""Unless you want to give me 1000 bucks...""

Anyway, I don't expect this to be an issue for the average customer, but this is not a store where it's worth digging around. You will be gouged for anything remotely cool that is found.

My favorite ❤️",Oliver Flexer,5,1736010939,"I could literally spend all day here. This is maybe my favourite store in Edmonton - the kind of bookstore that is relatively hard to come by nowadays, that both specialized in rare and antique books while also having a large selection of classics & nonfiction. The owner is lovely and if you come in on a quiet day he's usually happy to chat with you. Prices are also exceptionally reasonable, especially for the non-book merchandise. You can get genuine 19th century steel-engraving prints for under $20, and even the genuine antique books are very fairly priced according to age, condition and rarity. Also, on the off-chance that someone reading this happens to be a fanatic for Polar Exploration History like me l, there's a HUGE Polar Studies section with everything from Franklin to Cook, including very pretty old editions of some of the expedition memoirs.

Really though, half the time I come here I don't even buy anything. The atmosphere is so wonderful here and there's so much to look at that I can happily make an afternoon of just poking around. Think Pratchett's L-space. If you're a book lover or a lover of history, you owe it to yourself to pop in here next time you're on Whyte"

I recently stumbled upon a well-loved copy of The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho, a personal favorite, which sparked a warm chat with Terry about the book’s themes of destiny—perfectly in line with the store’s serendipitous vibe. The selection is diverse, with gems in multiple languages, making it a unique spot in a city dominated by French and English-language books.

The store’s ambiance is enhanced by Terry’s welcoming demeanor. He’s always ready to offer recommendations or negotiate prices, ensuring you leave with both a great deal and a smile. Prices are a steal—most books range from $5 to $15, ideal for budget-conscious readers. However, the shop is cash-only, so come prepared. The cramped space and limited hours (typically afternoons) might deter some, but they add to the old-school charm.

While the disorganized stacks can make browsing a treasure hunt, that’s part of the fun. If you’re seeking mainstream bestsellers or a spacious setting, you might look elsewhere, but for rare finds and a personal touch, Westcott Books is unmatched. It’s a must-visit for Montrealer's in La Petite-Patrie or anyone craving a literary adventure.",Millie K,2,1736645599,I visited here recently and was very excited to find some good non fiction books but got  really disappointed for not finding any in English.

So disappointed. :((,June Svetlovsky,5,1725757379,"I went for the first time today, and I suspect I’ll be back… weekly? You can find everything there.

A business that has its place and where dedication and passion are always omnipresent.  Going there means adopting it!

My 17-year-old son went there for the first time a few months ago and he only talks to me about this place. He's been going there at least once a week since he discovered the place. My brother went with her a few times and he recommended that I go there that it was a really good place and that I would probably like the place.... After hearing about it for months, several times per week..... On the way to an appointment with my son last week, we walked past. As he wanted to go there, I entered and as a matter of fact, I literally fell in love with this little store which contains a considerable quantity of little jewels for all tastes and all ages. Regardless of your literary preference, I am almost certain that the majority of people who love to read are sure to find a bit of happiness.  Just for information purposes, I went there for 3 days in a row... I highly recommend at least going to take a look. For my part, I will return there every time I need it if I have to buy a book. I will also go back every time I have the opportunity just to chat with the staff, great people. You feel at home as soon as you walk through the door. Bookstore with impeccable second-hand books at very low prices.

Worst experience in a bookstore of my entire life. I saw the most beautiful book ends in the window 2 days ago and was waiting to go back to purchase them. I walked in excitedly with my father and approached the counter to ask the owner to look at them. As I walked up, the owner was shaking his arms at me and angrily said “what??” Before I even said anything to him. The first words out of my mouth were “I’m sorry” because I believed I must have offended him with my presence somehow. I asked to see the lovely book ends and he angrily said they are not for sale. He reached for them to show me and HE knocked over a pile of books in the process. Perhaps if behind the store wasn’t so chaotically disorganized and messy that wouldn’t have happened. He acted like it was my fault that he knocked over the books, and said “Now I’m even more upset that I have all these books to clean up” and huffed and glared at me. I don’t even touch the book ends as I am afraid to anger him further. I asked him if he remembers where he bought them from and he said shortly “store closed down 10 years ago, can’t get them anymore”. He then proceeded to complain about his personal issues and that he shouldn’t even be there today because he is sick but needs to pay his rent… which was not my fault as a customer. I was also looking for books as well but based on his treatment towards me I told my dad let’s just leave. Even though they weren’t for sale, I would have offered him more than his original purchase price for those book ends that he kept on a shelf collecting dust.

I reached out via FB as emails went unanswered.

On the tenth day they informed me their ""was an inventory mistake"" they went on to say they emailed but it probably went to junk mail and will refund me.

Im no noob I watch my junk mail in fact all folders there was no email sent.  There was no return to my account. At least not yet so they sat for near wo weeks knowing they had taken money under false pretenses and done nothing to remedy it.

AVG reports they are a scam website and fake online store.  Something I did not see until after Id approved the purchase
The ecommerce site they use is also not overly reputable.

I suspect its more likely they discovered the book was worth more than they had listed it for and will put it up for sale at a new improved rip off price.

Whatever the reasons do not trust this business with your money.   It does not take 10 days to see you made a ""inventory"" error  you do not need 10 days to start a refund nor do you only START the process until after the client reaches out to you."

You never know what you might find, like a treasure hunt for books.
So while doing a walk about in Owen Sound and I spied the Phoenix Book Store the hunt was on.
Interesting spot, packed with books, and some organization.
Fortunately my wife was busy shopping elsewhere so I had a solid hour plus in there.
And I came away with a few gems.
My parents were born and raised in Glengarry County, History of Glengarry, 1979, last printed in 1980.
Marked at $59.00 and the gentleman rounded it down to $50.
You would be looking upwards of $100+.
Bobby Orr, my favourite hockey player of all time, “My Story”, hardcover, for $15.
Amazon paperback $35.
And I’m a Blues music fan and a cool little book called Blues From the Delta by William Ferris, for $5. (Documentary on Mississippi Delta Blues).
On line you are going to pay ~$40.
Anyway, you get my drift, hit this great little book shop up!",Andrew B,5,1716041757,"Great book store in OS -very glad there is somewhere to find good things to read in OS.

When you enter you are definitely entering in the world of all readers! Books are easy to search as they are intelligently sorted. They may be are not in orders and only placed together but the fun of searching gets to you and brings you in the old days, which is what i love from this place!

The man/ owner is fabulous! He is always smiling, ready to help you and will even search to see if he has what you are looking for! I found so much books i love there!

I visited the store and spent about 40 minutes browsing books. During that time, the staff member repeatedly sprayed a vinegar and water solution around the space. At first, I didn’t think much of it, until she told me it was because my hair product scent was bothering her (for context, I wasn’t wearing any perfume). I apologized, even though I didn’t think the scent was strong.

A couple of minutes later, she came back and said “you’ve been in here for 45 minutes how much longer are you staying here, I can’t handle the smell anymore.” We weren’t even standing near her at that point. I ended up leaving before my boyfriend out of discomfort.

I completely understand sensitivity to smells, but spraying vinegar (which has a much stronger and harsher scent than any hair product) while customers are shopping is not the way to handle it. I felt embarrassed and unwelcome. It’s unfortunate because the store seemed nice at first, but I won’t be returning . I see other reviews that say the same thing that I experienced, at least put a sign on the door for others if there is a bad intolerance of scents. driving your customers out making them feel uncomfortable is not a good business moto.",Max 256,3,1745418996,"Iam not much of a reader, but my mom wanted to stop by and she seems to like it here.

She is always working so hard, without complaining. And to Heike who is always helping us to discover new authors and suggesting us titles of great books to read. They are a great asset to Renaissance Pierrefonds and it is always a pleasure to see them when we are in the neighbourhood.
Thank you ladies, for the excellent service you are providing to us.",Mona,1,1717439496,"Books mean a lot to me and my family. I spent a long time researching where to donate books as my husband and I are downsizing from a 5-bedroom family home where we raised our 4 kids over 32 years and we are now moving to an apartment. Purging the hundreds of items has been a huge undertaking, but never would we have imagined our beloved books (there were zero magazines, most of the books hard covers like new, some cooking books) might end up anywhere but in someone’s hands for new enjoyment.

We chose this particular branch of Renaissance because it specializes in books! Librairie is part of its name!

So imagine our shock and disappointment when the older gentleman inside the door grumpily mumbled ‘yeah? What do you want?’ to my husband as he entered. This man may be an unpaid volunteer, and I thank him for his service if that is the case. But he clearly hates his job so why do it? He literally told ny husband ‘we don’t take books’. What? My husband, who is 80 and in remarkable good shape, but 80 nonetheless, ignored the grumpy reception and instead continued to explain we had just packed up 10 boxes of like-new books which are sure to please the center’s users.

The man must have a change of heart when my husband told him that he was a kind man, without a note of irony or sarcasm, because the gentleman ended up helping my husband empty our car and bring the boxes of books inside. I was at the wheel of the car because I am mobility challenged and could not have helped, other than to park as close to the door as possible.

Anyway, I was so disappointed by the turn of events, especially after handpicking this organization for our precious books, it left us feeling as though we had been annoyances instead of eager donors.

Do your homework, folks. There has to be a better place, and way, of keeping our beloved books alive.",Alex O'Neill,5,1627580519,"Nice little bookstore – selling primarily, but not just books, but also CDs, puzzles, comic books & a few video games. A bit on the smaller side, but is packed with something for everyone – I seldom walk out empty-handed. Shelves are routinely stocked from a seemingly endless stream of donations. Heike & David, who work at this location usually, are friendly, cordial and great to talk to, and will recommend titles according to your tastes. I recommend the store to anyone in the area.",Felix Kjellberg,4,1669181736,"I had a great time at Library Center of Don Renaissance Pierrefonds! The staff was very friendly and helpful, and the facilities were clean and well-maintained. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great place to read, study, or just relax."

The man, whom I believe is the owner, has historically been a very pushy and particular individual. I didn't mind it in the past, as he usually also made some good recommendations based on what genres I was browsing. But today, my experience has completely put me off from ever visiting again nor recommending this store to anyone else. I brought a friend to the shop to show them the selection of books. He was already engaged with another customer, but immediately asked us what were looking for. I said we're just taking a look, he seemed annoyed at that. As soon as we took a step into an aisle he asked where we were going and commented on a very small bag I was wearing, with a hostile tone. He said to flip it to the front of my body, which I understand, given the messy over stacking of books he has in the store. And then proceeds to again ask what were looking for, which I said again just taking a look around. I've been to the third floor multiple times before without issue, but this time around as we went to the staircase, his hostility increased and he raised his voice asking us where we were going, that we're not allowed to go up. This is the first time I've ever been told something like this, and I've been here numerous times. I'm perplexed by his behavior, but seeing all the other reviews now I see this is a common issue with the staff here. It was an incredibly unwelcoming environment, and I felt incredibly awkward having brought a friend here for the first time. So we decided to just leave the store without any further engagement with him, and as we leave he simply snarkly commented thank you. Truly, there are many wonderful independent book stores you can visit and support instead of this store. Save yourself the trouble/exposure to this person.",Ali k,4,1709272507,"The shopkeeper is incredibly knowledgeable and helpful, offering recommendations tailored to your interests and providing insights into rare or unique finds.

The selection is unparalleled. I asked him how he came to have such a large collection of thins and he told me ""I write a lot of cheques, that's how.""
