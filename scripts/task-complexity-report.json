    {
      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Set Up Initial Astro Project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Astro project setup into specific implementation steps including: 1) Project initialization with CLI, 2) TypeScript configuration, 3) Tailwind CSS integration, 4) Project structure organization, and 5) Dependency management and verification.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves standard project setup procedures with well-documented steps. The complexity is moderate as it requires following Astro's opinionated project structure and integrating TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, but these are common patterns with clear documentation available."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement CSV Data Processing System for 48-Column Input",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the CSV processing system into subtasks covering: 1) CSV parser integration, 2) Schema definition with TypeScript and validation, 3) Error handling and reporting system, 4) Data transformation pipeline, 5) Output format optimization, and 6) Documentation and testing framework.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to the large number of columns (48), need for strict validation, error handling, and transformation logic. The system must be robust enough to handle various edge cases while maintaining data integrity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Store Discovery Interface with Advanced Search and Filtering",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the store discovery interface implementation into: 1) UI component architecture, 2) Search functionality implementation, 3) Filter system development, 4) Data integration from CSV processing, 5) Responsive design implementation, 6) Accessibility optimization, and 7) Performance tuning for large datasets.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex UI interactions, state management, and performance considerations for handling 271 stores with multiple filter criteria. The combination of search, filtering, responsive design, and accessibility requirements increases complexity significantly."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Interactive Store Mapping System with Marker Clustering and Mobile Controls",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the mapping system implementation into: 1) Map library integration with Astro, 2) Store marker plotting from processed data, 3) Marker clustering implementation, 4) Interactive popup development, 5) Mobile-optimized controls and gestures, and 6) Performance optimization and documentation.",
      "reasoning": "Implementing an interactive map with clustering requires complex client-side JavaScript, careful performance optimization, and mobile-specific considerations. Integration with Astro's partial hydration model adds another layer of complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Store Detail Pages with Complete Store Information and SEO Optimization",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the store detail page development into: 1) Dynamic page generation for 271 stores, 2) Store information display components, 3) Google reviews integration, 4) SEO optimization implementation, and 5) Performance and accessibility enhancements.",
      "reasoning": "While generating 271 pages is a substantial task, Astro's static site generation makes this manageable. The complexity comes from ensuring consistent SEO optimization across all pages and integrating external data like Google reviews."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Geographic Navigation System with State and City-Level Pages, Breadcrumbs, and SEO",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the geographic navigation system into: 1) Dynamic route generation for states and cities, 2) Location-based store filtering and display, 3) Breadcrumb navigation implementation with structured data, 4) SEO optimization for location pages, and 5) Integration with existing store detail pages.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires complex routing with Astro's getStaticPaths, hierarchical data organization, and careful SEO implementation. The interdependencies between different location levels and integration with existing pages increase complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement CSV Update Management with Validation, Backups, Diff Reports, and Automated Workflow",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the CSV update management system into: 1) CSV change detection mechanism, 2) Validation pipeline integration, 3) Automated backup system, 4) Diff reporting tool development, 5) CI/CD workflow integration, and 6) Documentation and recovery procedures.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves building a robust system with multiple interconnected components that must work reliably in an automated environment. The requirements for validation, versioning, diff reporting, and integration with CI/CD pipelines make this highly complex."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Performance Optimizations: CDN Delivery, Lazy Loading, Code Splitting, and Core Web Vitals",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide performance optimization efforts into: 1) CDN integration and configuration, 2) Image optimization and lazy loading implementation, 3) JavaScript code splitting strategy, 4) CSS optimization techniques, 5) Core Web Vitals specific improvements, and 6) Performance monitoring and reporting system.",
      "reasoning": "Performance optimization requires deep technical knowledge across multiple domains (networking, rendering, JavaScript execution) and careful measurement. The task spans the entire application and requires balancing multiple optimization techniques without compromising functionality."
